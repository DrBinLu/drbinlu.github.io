# About Me


Hi, I’m a renewable energy researcher living and working in Canberra — the capital of Australia. My work is all about helping countries shift to cleaner, smarter energy systems — especially across Australia and the Asia-Pacific.

My research focuses on energy system modelling, renewable resource assessment, and storage solutions. I developed the STORES Geographic Information System algorithm to identify off-river hydro storage across elevated landscapes — work that earned the Eureka Prize for Environmental Research. I also created the FIRM energy modelling tool, widely used across the Asia-Pacific to plan reliable, 100% renewable futures.

My research journey has taken me through Australia (PhD, Australian National University), China (ME & BE, Wuhan University), and the United States (Visiting Fellow, Stanford University) — experiences that shaped a global perspective on today’s energy challenges. I’ve been lucky to work with great teams, receive fellowships, and share this research with millions of people around the world.

## 🏔️ Beyond Work

When I’m not working, you’ll probably find me bushwalking, jogging by the beach, or digging into a good playlist of Bach and folk rock. I’m also into pale ale and Riesling — and I love cooking and hunting down great food spots.
