# About Me

Hi, I’m a Senior Research Fellow at the Australian National University, where I lead the Renewable Energy Systems Program as part of the Zero-Carbon Energy for the Asia-Pacific initiative. My work is all about helping countries shift to cleaner, smarter energy systems — especially across Australia and the Asia-Pacific.

My research focuses on energy system modelling, renewable resource assessment, and storage solutions. I developed the STORES Geographic Information System algorithm to identify off-river hydro storage across elevated landscapes — work that earned the Eureka Prize for Environmental Research. I also created the FIRM energy modelling tool, widely used across the Asia-Pacific to plan reliable, 100% renewable futures.

I’ve been lucky to work with great teams, receive fellowships, and share this research with millions of people around the world.
